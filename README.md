# dsl-final-project
In todayâ€™s digital world, food recipes are one of the most searched items online. According to Google, limited to the United States, recipe searching directed web traffic in the order of trillions in 2022. Many of these searches were associated with seasonal recipes, trending topics on social media, and recipes for meal prepping and healthy eating. As we look to spend less time in the kitchen without compromising pleasure or nurture, the need for comprehensive recipes that allow us to prepare delicious meals while optimizing what lays on our fridges, becomes a challenge worthy of research.

Our project emerges as a fusion of technological and gastronomic exploration. Within this report, we show our approach to building a custom recipe generator using a combination of image recognition and text generation; we created a model to identify a series of ingredients from images, and then, we created a program to generate a prompt to generate a custom recipe with those ingredients, using AI. First, we discuss previous implementations of this idea. Next, we review the methodology behind our own application, including applied strategies for image recognition of ingredients, and creating custom recipes from these ingredients. Finally, we discuss the results from our experiments and weigh the pros and cons of our design.
